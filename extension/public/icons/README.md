# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files:
- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

You can create simple icons using any image editor or use placeholder images for development.

For production, create proper icons that represent the fact-checking functionality.
